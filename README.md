Project in JAVA. Swing library. Emphasis is on development process where PowerDesigner is used to create requirements model, as well as functional and class models. 
The project is run via Eclipse IDE. Mumka is the name of the project.
Files containing models are located in models (2).zip file. Unfortunately they require PowerDesigner installed to be opened.
